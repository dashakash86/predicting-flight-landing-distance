1. The p-value for the F-test is significant. So we conclude the model as a whole is

2. Checking the p-values for each predictor variable we see that the ones staistically
significant are -  Speed-air, and Height
3. R-squared is 91.73, which means the model explains 91.73% of variability in Landing Distance.
4. So, we now go ahead and remodel. This time keeping out the predictors not statistically significant.

/*Model interpretation*/
/*
1. The p-value for the F-test is significant. So we conclude the model as a whole is 
statistically significant
2. Checking the p-values for predictor variables Height and Air Speed we see that they are statistically
significant.
3. R-squared is 90.81, which means the model explains 90.81% of variability in Landing Distance. R-squared has
come down a little bit as we removed insignificant variables, which means we lost information. But this model 
is a lot simpler too.
4. Though the intercept is also statistically significant it doesn't have much relevance because the values of 
Air speed and Height as zeroes are out of dataset range.
5. So our final model is 
  Landing Distance = -5935.72 + 80.5 * Air speed + 12.5 * Height
6. a. 1 unit of increase in Air speed will result in 80.5 units of increase in Landing Distance, 
keeping all other variables constant.
   b. 1 unit of increase in Height will result in 12.5 units of increase in Landing Distance, 
keeping all other variables constant.

/*Findings are - 
1. For Airbus planes, statistically significant variables to predict Landing Distance 
tend to be - Air speed, Ground Speed, and Height.
2. For Boeing planes, Landing distance predictors are Air speed and Height. 
3. Sample estimate of the predictor height is more in case of Boeing than Airbus, which means 
a unit change in height affects the landing distance more for Boeing than Airbus planes.
4. Sample estimate for the predictor Air speed is more in case of Airbus than Boeing, which means 
a unit change in Air speed affects landing distance more for Airbus than Boeing.
