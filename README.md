# predicting-flight-landing-distance
Federal Aviation Administration case study: 
Analysis of 950 commercial flights to draw insights on what factors affect the flight landing distance. This was done through data importing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization. 

Also, a predictive model (using Linear Regression) was built to predict landing distance so that risk of landing overrun can be reduced.
