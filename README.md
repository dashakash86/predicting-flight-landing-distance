# predicting-flight-landing-distance
Federal Aviation Administration case study: 
Analysis of 950 commercial flights to draw insights on what factors affect the flight landing distance. This was done through data importing, dataset merging, treatment of missing values, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization. 

Also, a predictive model (using Linear Regression) was built to predict landing distance so that risk of landing overrun can be reduced. 

## Tools Used: 
SAS

## Variables analyzed
** Aircraft: The make of an aircraft (Boeing or Airbus).
Duration (in minutes): Flight duration between taking off and landing. The duration of a normal flight should always be greater than 40min.
No_pasg: The number of passengers in a flight.
Speed_ground (in miles per hour): The ground speed of an aircraft when passing over the threshold of the runway. If its value is less than 30MPH or greater than 140MPH, then the landing would be considered as abnormal.
Speed_air (in miles per hour): The air speed of an aircraft when passing over the threshold of the runway. If its value is less than 30MPH or greater than 140MPH, then the landing would be considered as abnormal.
Height (in meters): The height of an aircraft when it is passing over the threshold of the runway. The landing aircraft is required to be at least 6 meters high at the threshold of the runway
